Prompt: This guaranteed automobile protection ('GAP') contract ('GAP Addendum') amends the  Financing Contract. This GAP Addendum is between the Customer/Borrower and the  dealer/lender/lessor ('We', 'Us', or 'Our') (or if assigned, with the assignee). Although  not required to do so, the Customer/Borrower has elected to participate in Our GAP  program.  GAP does not take the place of insurance on the vehicle. The Customer/Borrower is  responsible for maintaining collision and comprehensive insurance on and for the  full value of the Covered Vehicle and any other insurance required by the Financing  Contract or applicable law. The Customer/Borrower is responsible for any and all  notifications and claims that are required to be filed with their automobile insurance  company with respect to the Covered Vehicle. We will not process or handle any  insurance claims for the Customer/Borrower.  TERMINATION OF THIS GAP ADDENDUM  This GAP Addendum will terminate on the date that any of the following events occur:  1. the date the Customer/Borrower’s Financing Contract is scheduled to terminate; 2.  upon payment in full of the Financing Contract; 3. expiration of any redemption period  following the repossession or surrender of the Covered Vehicle; 4. in the event of a  Constructive Total Loss or theft of the Covered Vehicle; 5. the date the Financing  Contract is prepaid or the Financing Contract is refinanced; 6. the Covered Vehicle is  sold, assigned, or transferred before the expiration date of the Customer/Borrower’s  Financing Contract (except in the case of a transfer of equity); or 7. Eighty-four (84)  months after the inception date of this GAP Addendum. If the Financing Contract  terminates early due to prepayment, refinancing, or other reasons, the Customer/Borrower  may be entitled to a refund or a credit of any unearned GAP charge. Notice of early  termination of the Financing Contract may be made at the location this GAP Addendum  was purchased or contact the GAP Administrator.

THROUGH THE CUSTOMER/BORROWER’S SIGNATURE BELOW,  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND AGREEMENT THAT ACCEPTANCE OF THIS GAP ADDENDUM IS  VOLUNTARY AND IS NOT REQUIRED TO OBTAIN CREDIT; DOES NOT IMPACT THE  CUSTOMER/BORROWER’S ABILITY TO OBTAIN ANY PARTICULAR OR MORE FAVORABLE CREDIT  TERMS; AND HAS NO EFFECT ON THE TERMS OF THE RELATED SALE OF THE COVERED VEHICLE.  Coverage under this GAP Addendum may decrease over the term of the Covered Vehicle’s  Financing Contract, and may not extend for the full term of the Covered Vehicle’s  Financing Contract. The Customer/Borrower may wish to consult with an alternative  source to determine whether similar coverage may be obtained and at what cost.
