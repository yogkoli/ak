Here is a description of the data set you might use for training:

    Documents: The data set should include a collection of documents in a digital format, such as text files, PDFs, or HTML files. The documents can be of varying lengths and may contain a combination of text, numbers, symbols, and other characters.

    Labels: Each document in the data set should be associated with one or more labels or categories. These labels represent the classes or topics you want the model to classify the documents into. For example, if you're building a news article classification system, the labels might include categories like "sports," "politics," "entertainment," and so on.

    Labeled Examples: Each document in the data set should be manually labeled with the appropriate category or categories. This labeling process involves human annotators going through the documents and assigning the correct labels based on their content. The labeling should be consistent and accurate to ensure reliable training.

    Data Distribution: The data set should ideally have a balanced distribution of documents across different categories. This means that each category should be represented by a sufficient number of examples to avoid bias and ensure that the model learns from a diverse range of instances. However, in real-world scenarios, data sets might be imbalanced, with some categories having more examples than others.

    Data Preprocessing: The data set may require preprocessing steps to prepare it for training. This can include cleaning the text by removing unnecessary characters, normalizing the text by converting it to lowercase, removing stop words, and performing other transformations to improve the quality of the input data.
