GAP ADDENDUM #SAMPLESAMPLE
This guaranteed automobile protection (“GAP”) contract (“GAP Addendum”) amends the
Financing Contract. This GAP Addendum is between the Customer/Borrower and the
dealer/lender/lessor (“We”, “Us”, or “Our”) (or if assigned, with the assignee). Although
not required to do so, the Customer/Borrower has elected to participate in Our GAP
program.
GAP does not take the place of insurance on the vehicle. The Customer/Borrower is
responsible for maintaining collision and comprehensive insurance on and for the
full value of the Covered Vehicle and any other insurance required by the Financing
Contract or applicable law. The Customer/Borrower is responsible for any and all
notifications and claims that are required to be filed with their automobile insurance
company with respect to the Covered Vehicle. We will not process or handle any
insurance claims for the Customer/Borrower.
TERMINATION OF THIS GAP ADDENDUM
This GAP Addendum will terminate on the date that any of the following events occur:
1. the date the Customer/Borrower’s Financing Contract is scheduled to terminate; 2.
upon payment in full of the Financing Contract; 3. expiration of any redemption period
following the repossession or surrender of the Covered Vehicle; 4. in the event of a
Constructive Total Loss or theft of the Covered Vehicle; 5. the date the Financing
Contract is prepaid or the Financing Contract is refinanced; 6. the Covered Vehicle is
sold, assigned, or transferred before the expiration date of the Customer/Borrower’s
Financing Contract (except in the case of a transfer of equity); or 7. Eighty-four (84)
months after the inception date of this GAP Addendum. If the Financing Contract
terminates early due to prepayment, refinancing, or other reasons, the Customer/Borrower
may be entitled to a refund or a credit of any unearned GAP charge. Notice of early
termination of the Financing Contract may be made at the location this GAP Addendum
was purchased or contact the GAP Administrator.
ENROLLMENT IS AVAILABLE ONLY AT THE TIME THE FINANCING CONTRACT IS
ORIGINALLY EXECUTED. THROUGH THE CUSTOMER/BORROWER’S SIGNATURE BELOW,
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND AGREEMENT THAT ACCEPTANCE OF THIS GAP ADDENDUM IS
VOLUNTARY AND IS NOT REQUIRED TO OBTAIN CREDIT; DOES NOT IMPACT THE
CUSTOMER/BORROWER’S ABILITY TO OBTAIN ANY PARTICULAR OR MORE FAVORABLE CREDIT
TERMS; AND HAS NO EFFECT ON THE TERMS OF THE RELATED SALE OF THE COVERED VEHICLE.
Coverage under this GAP Addendum may decrease over the term of the Covered Vehicle’s
Financing Contract, and may not extend for the full term of the Covered Vehicle’s
Financing Contract. The Customer/Borrower may wish to consult with an alternative
source to determine whether similar coverage may be obtained and at what cost. The
Customer/Borrower acknowledges that they have read and understand this GAP
Addendum contract and all of its provisions. No other verbal representation(s) has
been made to the Customer/Borrower which differ from the written provisions. If the
Customer/Borrower purchased this GAP Addendum from Us, they also understand that
the financial institution/lender may retain all or a portion of the charge paid by them. This
GAP Addendum includes a binding arbitration clause. The Customer/Borrower should
carefully read this entire GAP Addendum contract for additional information on eligibility,
requirements, conditions and exclusions that could prevent them from receiving the
waiver of debt hereunder.
In the event of a Constructive Total Loss to the Covered Vehicle, We agree to waive Our
rights against the Customer/Borrower for the amount due under a Payable Loss. In addition
to the provisions of a Payable Loss, the Customer/Borrower will remain responsible for
payment of any items stated under the EXCLUSIONS section below.
